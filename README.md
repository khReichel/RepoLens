## Overview

**RepoLens**  is an advanced repository analytics platform that extracts and interprets version control metadata to uncover software evolution patterns, code quality risks, and team interaction dynamics.
By bridging the gap between raw Git history and actionable insights, Pulseflow empowers engineering teams to manage technical debt proactively, optimize their architecture, and improve collaboration.

It uses pre-built Docker images and a configurable workflow to provide actionable insights **without requiring users to build images locally**.
---

## Key Features
--

RepoLens provides a multi-dimensional view of your software project across **Files**, **Modules**, and **Teams**:

###  Evolution & Pulse
* **Hotspot Trends:** Identifies files and modules that are becoming increasingly problematic ("Rising") or stabilizing ("Cooling") by comparing historical baselines with current activity.
* **Activity Recency:** Quickly spot abandoned legacy code versus areas of intense recent development.
* **Code Churn:** Analyze the raw volume of changes (added/deleted lines) to find unstable components.

###  Structure & Logic
* **Combined Complexity:** A holistic view combining *Cognitive Complexity*, *Cyclomatic Complexity*, and structural *Effort* to pinpoint exactly where code is hardest to maintain.

###  Team & Knowledge (Conway's Law in Action)
* **Code Ownership & Fragmentation:** Identify knowledge silos (single points of failure/Bus Factor) and fragmented code (too many developers touching the same file).
* **Module-Team Alignment:** Visualize which teams effectively "own" which architectural components, helping to align software architecture with team topology.

## Quick Start

### 1. Prepare Configuration

RepoLens uses a **`config.yaml`** file in the `config/` directory. Example:

```yaml
project:
  name: "myproject"
  db_path: "/app/data"
  db_update_path: "/app/data/update_data"
  db_basename: "repolens"
  repo_path: "/repo"
```

> Paths defined in the config are automatically mapped to the containers. Users do **not** need to change any file system paths manually.

---

### 2. Start RepoLens Runtime

```bash
./manage.sh up
```

This will start:

* `backend` (API and analysis engine)
* `ui` (frontend dashboard)
* `gateway` (Nginx for web access)

Stop containers:

```bash
./manage.sh down
```

---

### 3. Import Repository Data (Staging)

```bash
./manage.sh import /path/to/local/repo
```

* Imports repository data **into the staging database** (`db_update_path`).
* No live data is modified yet.
* If no path is provided, the `repo_path` from `config.yaml` is used.

---

### 4. Refresh Runtime Database

```bash
./manage.sh refresh
```

* Atomically swaps the staging database into the runtime database (`db_path`).
* Stops the backend container briefly to allow the swap.
* Creates a timestamped backup of the previous runtime database.
* Restarts the backend container automatically.

---

### 5. Update Docker Images

```bash
./manage.sh pull    # Pull latest images
./manage.sh update  # Pull latest images and restart containers
```

---

### 6. Optional: View Logs

```bash
docker compose logs -f
```

## Architecture

* **Backend:** FastAPI + Python for metrics and analysis.
* **Storage:** DuckDB, embedded, high-performance analytical DB.
* **UI:** React + Tailwind CSS, served through Nginx gateway.
* **Importer:** CLI tool inside container, processes Git history and populates staging DB.

---

## Recommended Workflow

1. `import` → Import repository into staging.
2. `refresh` → Swap staging DB into runtime atomically.
3. `update` → Pull latest container images and restart runtime.
4. Repeat steps 1–3 daily or as needed.

---

## Notes

* All paths are read from `config.yaml` and mapped correctly in Docker Compose.
* The staging workflow ensures **zero downtime** for the backend during updates.
* Backups are automatically created before every refresh.
